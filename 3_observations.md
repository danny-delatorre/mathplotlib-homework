# Matplotlib Homework - 3 Observations

3 Observations: 

1. When analyzing my generated line plot in Jupyter Notebook, it can clear that the drug Capomulin proved to be incredibly useful in combating the 
overall tumor volume. The visualization below shows how over the period from time point 0 - 45, Capomulin effectivity minimized the overall tumor volume 
in Mouse s185, as evidenced by a downward sloping trend line.

2.  When observing the generated pie plots, it can be said with 100% certainty that there are slightly more male mice in the dataset, 50.7%, as opposed to 
female mice in the dataset, 49.3%. However, it cannot be said with certainty whether or not gender influences the trial results. Ultimately, due to the only 
slight disparity that exists in the dataset between the two genders, I tend to believe that the difference in the overall count by gender should have little to no 
effect on the credibility of the dataset final results of the trials.

3. When looking at the linear regression for mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin drug regimen, it can be said when seeing the visualization 
that a direct relationship exists concerning overall tumor volume and mouse weight, as evidenced by the linear regression. The linear regression line shows a 
direct correlation between the two: as tumor volume increases, mouse weight increases, visa versa.
